		<h1>Welcome to the Potential Organizer</h1>
		<p class="item">
			It's prerelease version of site (something like v0.9.8), and the fact that you are here just means only 
			one: you know who I am.
			Sound like some speech of main villain, isn't it? Anyway this site 
			<em style="text-decoration: line-through">alive (evil_laugh.mp3)</em> works and you can use it.
			So, welcome here. Hope this is not the last time. 
		</p>
		<h2>Getting started guide</h2>
		<p class="item">
			First of all, create an account. For that there are some easy steps:<br>
			   1. Click the "Sign Up" link in right side in header. You will redirected to the signup page.<br>
			   2. Correctly fill in the form. If username that you try to choose is not occupied — account will 
			creater and you will be redirected in this page.<br>
			   3. If you aren't redirected — some error (that i forgot to caught) has been caused. Hope that you 
			just try to sign up with existing username, but is it really so?
		</p>
		<p class="item">
			If you was succesfully redirected previously, now you can also succesfylly logging in. Do you wanna some steps 
			for this? All right, all right, here they are:<br>
			   1. Click "Log In" link, to the left of the "Sign up" link.<br>
			   2. Correctly fill the form, you know. There are just two fields and you right now create an account. Then 
			submit the form. If "OK", you will be redireted here, again.
		</p>
		<p class="item">
			After logging in you will gail access to the "Todo" page, "Account" page and "Logout" page.<br>
			Account and logout links are hidden in dropdown menu that named "Menu".<br>
			You can play around with todos, edit your info, then logout. Or not, doesn't matter.<br>
			But i hope that at least one time you check my logout link. If you check, you will see almost cutest logging off 
			in the world, i guess.
		</p>
		<p class="item">
			Oh, one more thing. As i said at the start ot this topic, it's prerelease version. In final, 1.0.0, version this 
			page will contain pictures instead of this text wall. Pls wait for this moment ◕‿◕.
		</p>
		<h2>So, enjoy my creation</h2>
		<label id="sorry">
			yeah, there is no at least great text styling because i lost all my 
			imagination in order to just wrote this text, sorry
